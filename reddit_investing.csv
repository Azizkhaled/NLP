The first, if all the banks were closing down and filing for bankruptcy… how did they payout the people who shorted the bonds? Meaning, if they have no money, then how can they pay you? Is there like a middleman where they hold each others money and the winner keeps it all? Lol kinda like escrow holding the buyers money until everything works out.

Second questions, how did they all cash in the checks? Like Ryan Gosling’s character got a $47M check. If he deposited it into a bank (which is only FDIC insured up to $250k) and the bank closed or froze withdrawals, he just lost all that money."|0.86|65|0|65

We are closing on 6 acres on a lake we paid cash for which will leave us about 25k for an emergency fund. We want to build a vacation home/Air BnB on the lake and are also planning on starting a family next year. Only debt is 184k on our house which we pay $1600 a month for and our cars are paid off and are 3 year old toyotas. By lowering our 401k contributions to 6%, Max Roth IRA and HSA we would still be putting away 36k a year (including employer match). With compounding interest this should be 2.9m in 25 years with a 5% return. Or 30 years at 5% is 4m. We live in the Midwest and would have no debt when we retire. Does this sound ok? So many people here say max 401k no matter what so this feels weird but we really front loaded it and now will have extra expenses. Also not to be a doomer but the economy is making me feel uneasy so a bigger cushion would lower my stress in the case of me getting laid off, wife is a nurse so she is probably safe.|0.73|88|0|88
15reh20|1692064638.0|investing|Can someone justify the existence of fund managers to me?|"I spent the day trawling through a random investment management company (Invesco) looking at all their investment packages. 

Now it's all very sophisticated and operating at a level an amateur never could. Each fund containing 100+ companies, many I've never heard of, I'm sure carefully weighted. ESG considerations, region specific things. Funds focusing on Asia small cap, European mid cap, fixed income markets, investment grade corporate bonds.

The thing is almost every single one of them has performed terribly. Almost none have outperformed the S&P or even come close to it. A lot a down from 10 years ago, specifically the Asian ones. A couple of US equities have very very slightly beat the market, but if you take out management fees I'm not even sure if it wins.

I'm just wondering, what do these people think of themselves? I'm sure they have meetings where they assess their performance. Is there an awkward silence in the room when they show that their fund focused on ""long term capital growth"" with a 1% management fee is down 10% in the last 10 years? I'm sure they're all on high 6 figure salaries too. Do they look at their job as worthwhile? All they've done is lose money or underperform the market. You can view the profile of the fund manager, all have great credentials and decades of experience... and all for what? To be paid millions to lose people's money?

I'm not even saying they're bad managers, it seems being a manager of a fund focused on Asia has been doomed to failure. And any play that *could* drastically beat the market they probably aren't even allowed to do anyway. 

They all have huge NAV too so there's clearly lots of demand for these 1000 different packages. I wonder where it all comes from. Who is using these? Who looks at ""Invesco Belt and Road Bond Fund - A(RMB Hgd) MD -1"" and thinks, yes, give me that one.

I'm sure you could say these funds provide benefit by providing capital to many smaller entities but at that point it's just a charity.

I guess i could understand it more if these were all tiny funds that's a very niche corner of the market used by gamblers, but its the complete opposite of that. They're *huge* with billions / trillions of dollars under management. Where does it all come from and why?"|0.65|8|0|8

15qsonm|1692014353.0|investing|If you can deduct losses from taxes, does that mean your risk tolerance increases as you pay more taxes?|"Of course you don't want to go into investing with the intention of losing as money not earned is equivalent to money lost. Individuals who may need liquidity in the short term (entrepreneurs or business owners) can be forced to ""accept"" lower returns in the form of a bond ladder with short maturity rates.

However if your income is large (and thus you pay lots of income tax, say 20k last year) in theory you could move 20k you'd otherwise have in a bond ladder to an ETF. If you happen to need liquidity when the market has taken a downturn, just sell enough of your holdings at a 20k loss and deduct from taxes. It's not ideal, but you retain the upside of potential liquidation at market upturns without having to take a loss at a downturn.

15re07f|1692063400.0|investing|Why is a mix of passive and active management not typically recommended?|"Hypothetically, if all investors suddenly allocated exclusively to index funds, market cap proportions within an index would never change, and all stock prices within the index would change by an equal percentage.

The market needs some form of “active” management, through purchases of individual securities, for prices to respond individually (by unequal proportions) to earnings and industry events.

Given this logic (which might be flawed to begin with - let me know), wouldn’t it make sense for investors to allocate some portion of a portfolio to actively managed funds? I’m on board with index funds as the gold standard, but if I take the concept of ""indexing is best"" to its logical conclusion, I'm left thinking there is some value within active management that investors would be missing by indexing."|0.78|5|0|5

15r9f9u|1692052307.0|investing|How do you allocate asset classes across different taxable and retirement accounts?|"If you had the following:  
1.  inherited IRA that you were required to take RMDs from and you are planning on taking the minimum required from there every year  
2. a Roth IRA  
3. a Traditional IRA that you are not required to take RMDs from  
4. A normal individual taxable account  
How would you try to allocate ETFs for domestic stocks, international stocks, domestic bonds and international bonds in those accounts if you were looking for a 90% stock and 10% bond allocation if you were just saving for retirement in a few decades?  (US stocks being 54%, International Stocks being 36%, US bonds being 7%, and International bonds being 3% of the portfolio)  
I think that you would want the roth IRA to be 100% either domestic or international stocks because you would want to take advantage that gains from that account were not taxed when you withdraw them and have that grow as much as possible.  Try to have it at 60% domestic stocks and 40% international so your risk is spread across those two asset classes.    
I think you would want to have the inherited IRA with the largest allocation of either domestic or international stocks that your strategy allows because you want to have the money grow as much as possible before you are required to withdraw it.    
I think you would want to try to maintain the traditional IRA at some split of equities and bonds so you can rebalance there without making a tax liability. Maybe 50:50 of the value split between stocks and bonds, or more because you will likely have to sell stocks and buy bonds in the future because stocks grow more.    
Finally, you use the individual account to balance your portfolio according to your strategy and buy as many stocks and bonds that you need to meet the target allocations I mentioned above.

Investors and traders are eager to find out how their favorite companies performed in the past quarter and what their outlook is for the future.  
  
  
  
GP - GreenPower Motor Company Inc.  
  
  
  
Consensus EPS: -$0.12  
  
  
  
Basic Information: GP is a Canadian company that designs, manufactures, and distributes electric vehicles, including buses, cargo vans, and trucks. The company aims to provide cost-effective and environmentally friendly transportation solutions for various markets and applications.  
  
  
  
Detailed Summary Technical analysis: GP has been in a downtrend since reaching its all-time high of $6.05 in March 2023. The stock has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating bearish momentum. The relative strength index (RSI) is near the oversold level of 30, suggesting that the stock may be due for a bounce or a consolidation. The MACD histogram is negative and below the signal line, confirming the downward pressure. The stock faces resistance at $4.04, which is the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from $6.05 to $3.79. A break above this level could open the door for a recovery towards $4.55, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. On the other hand, if the stock fails to hold above $3.79, which is the recent low and a psychological support level, it could slide further towards $3.50 or $3.00, which are previous support levels from January and December 2022.  
  
  
  
Detailed Summary Fundamental analysis: GP’s earnings performance has been mixed in the past four quarters, with two beats and two misses. The company reported a loss of $0.14 per share in Q3 2023, matching the consensus estimate. The company’s revenue increased by 28% year-over-year to $12.77 million, driven by higher sales of its EV Star and EV Star Plus models. The company also delivered its first EV Star CC model to NASA in Q3 2023. However, the company’s operating expenses increased by 39% year-over-year to $13.07 million, mainly due to higher research and development costs and general and administrative expenses. The company’s net loss widened by 7% year-over-year to $12.93 million. For Q4 2023, analysts expect GP to report a loss of $0.12 per share on revenue of $18.86 million, representing a year-over-year improvement of 52% and 157%, respectively. The company’s guidance for Q4 2023 is a revenue range of $18 million to $20 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2 million to $4 million. The company expects to benefit from increased demand for its products in various markets, such as school transportation, airport shuttle services, paratransit services, and last-mile delivery services.

Detailed Summary Outlook: GP’s outlook for fiscal year 2024 is optimistic, as the company expects to achieve revenue growth of over 100% and positive adjusted EBITDA. The company also expects to increase its production capacity from 1,000 units per year to 5,000 units per year by the end of fiscal year 2024. The company believes that it has a competitive advantage in the electric vehicle market due to its proprietary technology, diversified product portfolio, strong customer relationships, and experienced management team. The company also expects to benefit from favorable regulatory and environmental trends that support the adoption of electric vehicles globally.  
  
  
  
Educational Prediction: Based on our technical and fundamental analysis, we believe that GP has a chance to beat the consensus estimate for Q4 2023, as the company may report higher-than-expected revenue growth due to strong demand for its products in various markets. However, we also acknowledge that the stock faces significant downside risks due to its high operating expenses, negative cash flow, and competitive pressures from other electric vehicle manufacturers. Therefore, we advise investors to be cautious and use proper risk management techniques when trading GP around its earnings report.  
  
  
  
HUT - Hut 8 Mining Corp.  
  
  
  
Consensus EPS: -$0.05  
  
  
  
Basic Information: HUT is a Canadian company that engages in cryptocurrency mining, primarily Bitcoin. The company operates several data centers that use specialized hardware and software to solve complex mathematical problems and validate transactions on the Bitcoin network. The company earns rewards in the form of newly minted Bitcoins and transaction fees for its mining activities.  
  
  
  
Detailed Summary Technical analysis: HUT has been in an uptrend since reaching its 52-week low of $0.78 in July 2023. The stock has been trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating bullish momentum. The RSI is near the overbought level of 70, suggesting that the stock may be overextended or due for a pullback. The MACD histogram is positive and above the signal line, confirming the upward pressure. The stock faces resistance at $3.00, which is a round number and a psychological barrier. A break above this level could open the door for a rally towards $3.50 or $4.00, which are previous resistance levels from April and March 2023. On the other hand, if the stock fails to sustain above $3.00, it could retrace towards $2.50 or $2.00, which are previous support levels from August and July 2023.  
  
  
  
Detailed Summary Fundamental analysis: HUT’s earnings performance has been volatile in the past four quarters, with two beats and two misses. The company reported earnings of $0.51 per share in Q1 2023, beating the consensus estimate of -$0.16 per share. The company’s revenue increased by 772% year-over-year to $19.02 million, driven by higher Bitcoin prices and mining volumes. The company also achieved positive net income of $34.02 million and positive adjusted EBITDA of $37.15 million in Q1 2023, compared to net losses of $8.44 million and $5.18 million, respectively, in Q1 2022. However, the company’s operating expenses increased by 165% year-over-year to $14.99 million, mainly due to higher depreciation and amortization costs and general and administrative expenses. For Q2 2023, analysts expect HUT to report a loss of $0.05 per share on revenue of $18.15 million, representing a year-over-year decline of 90% and 2%, respectively. The company’s guidance for Q2 2023 is a revenue range of $18 million to $20 million and an adjusted EBITDA range of -$2 million to -$4 million. The company expects to face challenges in Q2 2023 due to lower Bitcoin prices, higher network difficulty, and increased competition from other miners. The company also expects to incur higher operating costs due to its expansion plans and strategic initiatives.  
  
  
  
Detailed Summary Outlook: HUT’s outlook for the second half of 2023 is positive, as the company expects to benefit from its recent acquisitions of AllCell Technologies and Blockstream Mining Corp., which will enhance its energy storage and mining capabilities, respectively. The company also expects to increase its Bitcoin production from 1,000 units per month to 5,000 units per month by the end of 2023, as it deploys more efficient and powerful mining equipment. The company believes that it has a competitive advantage in the cryptocurrency mining industry due to its low-cost and renewable energy sources, diversified revenue streams, strong balance sheet, and experienced management team. The company also expects to benefit from favorable market trends that support the adoption and demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies globally.  
  
  
  
Educational Prediction: Based on our technical and fundamental analysis, we believe that HUT has a chance to miss the consensus estimate for Q2 2023, as the company may report lower-than-expected revenue and earnings due to lower Bitcoin prices, higher network difficulty, and increased competition from other miners in Q2 2023. However, we also acknowledge that the stock has strong upside potential due to its recent acquisitions, expansion plans, and positive outlook for the second half of 2023. Therefore, we advise investors to be optimistic but cautious when trading HUT around its earnings report.

The MACD histogram is negative and below the signal line, confirming the downward pressure. The stock faces resistance at $10.00, which is a round number and a psychological barrier. A break above this level could open the door for a recovery towards $12.00 or $14.00, which are previous support levels from May and April 2023. On the other hand, if the stock fails to hold above $8.00, which is the recent low and a key support level, it could slide further towards $6.00 or $4.00, which are previous support levels from December 2022 and October 2022.  
  
  
  
Detailed Summary Fundamental analysis: BTAI’s earnings performance has been disappointing in the past four quarters, with four consecutive misses. The company reported a loss of $0.58 per share in Q1 2023, missing the consensus estimate of -$0.47 per share. The company’s revenue decreased by 97% year-over-year to $0.05 million, mainly due to lower collaboration revenue from its partnership with Nektar Therapeutics. The company’s operating expenses increased by 32% year-over-year to $22.66 million, mainly due to higher research and development costs and general and administrative expenses. The company’s net loss widened by 38% year-over-year to $22.61 million. For Q2 2023, analysts expect BTAI to report a loss of $0.48 per share on revenue of $0.05 million, representing a year-over-year improvement of 17% and no change, respectively. The company’s guidance for Q2 2023 is not available at this time.  
  
  
  
Detailed Summary Outlook: BTAI’s outlook for the rest of 2023 is uncertain, as the company faces several regulatory and clinical milestones that could have a significant impact on its stock price and valuation. The company expects to submit a new drug application (NDA) for BXCL501 for acute treatment of agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Q3 2023, based on positive results from its pivotal phase 3 trials (SERENITY I and II). The company also expects to report top-line results from its phase 3 trial (TRANQUILITY) of BXCL501 for acute treatment of agitation in geriatric dementia in Q4 2023, as well as interim results from its phase 1b/2 trial (RELEASE) of BXCL701 for treatment of advanced prostate cancer in Q4 2023. The company also plans to initiate several other clinical trials for BXCL501 and BXCL701 in various indications, such as opioid withdrawal symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma. The company believes that it has a competitive advantage in the biopharmaceutical industry due to its unique artificial intelligence platform, innovative product candidates, strong intellectual property portfolio, and experienced management team. The company also expects to benefit from favorable market trends that support the unmet medical needs and growing demand for effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers.  
  
  
  
Educational Prediction: Based on our technical and fundamental analysis, we believe that BTAI has a chance to meet the consensus estimate for Q2 2023, as the company may report stable revenue and reduced losses due to lower operating costs and higher gross margins in Q2 2023. However, we also acknowledge that the stock has high volatility and uncertainty due to its dependence on regulatory and clinical outcomes for its lead product candidates in the second half of 2023. Therefore, we advise investors to be careful and use proper risk management techniques when trading BTAI around its earnings report.

Educational Prediction: Based on our technical and fundamental analysis, we believe that GOEV has a chance to beat the consensus estimate for Q2 2023, as the company may report lower-than-expected losses due to lower operating costs and higher gross margins in Q2 2023.

15pkdng|1691886486.0|investing|Investing 100k cautiously in this market.|"I've been slacking on getting better about investing for the last few years as my salary has increased.  I have been maxing Roth IRA and contributing up to match on 401k(I'm thinking about maxing this as well).  I have about 136k in retirement accounts.

I'm at the point where I know I'm just being triggershy and losing money/time so I need to make some decisions.

I have around 140k in cash which is just getting eaten into by inflation and I'm not currently using a high yield savings account.

I'm tentatively planning on moving 40k to a HYSA as an emergency fund, it's a bit more than 6 months of expenses but I'm in tech and the sector is kind of unstable right now.

I've been thinking of just putting the rest in VTI/VSUX and letting it sit(I'm 37) - I shouldn't need it until retirement, and then contributing any income above what I need to keep that emergency fund around ~40k as it comes in.

I'm a little apprehensive as I read a lot of concerns about a recession but I also understand the argument for time in the market vs timing the market.

I don't have any debt other than my mortgage and make a little over 200k.  I realize this is a pretty high income, and it might seem ridiculous asking for advice, but I am also pretty concerned about layoffs in the tech sector and a potentially long stint of unemployment if we see a 2000s style bubble bursting.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan?"|0.84|220|0|220

But its nothing ridiculous. They have been supportive of me financially as well growing up and I've had a bank account with a small allowance that I never really indulged with because it was my understanding it was theirs not mine. 

Well they told me I could do whatever with the money now that I have a job and I'm debating putting close to 60% in the S&P 500, dollar cost averaged over the next 12-18 months. My own job doesn't pay a lot, but I figured that this would be the head start I need, which would be about $70,000 combining my own money with theirs considering I already don't touch it. I read the intelligent investor and I think it's a good idea. I know because I'm young I should be riskier but I know barely anyone beats the S&P 500 over a long period of time. It would only leave about a 6 month emergency fund left in savings.

Any thoughts? I'm 23.

I have about $10k just sitting there and plan to start adding more money to a max of $50k

It's currently earning 4.9% interest and instead of the money sitting in my checking account earning nothing, might as well get the interest

I see posts/comments here that Robinhood could be a shady company (not sure why), hence I'm planning to cap at $50k to continue to earn interest. I'm viewing this as my semi-emergency funds 

The rest of the money, I will use my regular Fidelity account and continue to invest and build my portfolio

* Apple expanded from hardware to service ecosystem
* Apple switched from just buying chips to designing them (peak with the M-series)
* obviously, Netflix changed from physical copies to streaming
* when the clothing industry went heavy on offshoring in the 90's (?)
* US Digital companies optimized their business through tax optimization (in EU through Ireland)
* Surprisingly the industry in the agricultural sector is leading in many new innovations like autonomous driving/automation with leaders like Deere.

I have AMZN stocks purchased more than a year ago at 100k$ and are now worth 150k$

I have ARKK stocks purchased more than a year ago at 20k$ and are now worth 5k$

I want to sell all my ARKK and enough AMZN in a way to have capital losses from ARKK balance out with capital gain from AMZN but not fully, I want to keep an additional 3000$ that’s not covered by the AMZN gains to use it to reduce my taxable income. 

Is this the right math?

AMZN Capital Gain = 50k
ARKK Capital loss = 15k

Therefore I need to sell 15k of ARKK (all my ARKK stocks) and enough AMZN stocks that have gains totaling 12k. This way I save on paying taxes on 12k of AMZN and I reduce my taxable income by 3k. Is this correct?

Follow-up: how can I determine how many AMZN stocks I need to sell to get to a gain of 12k? (Let’s assume AMZN cost basis is 100$)

I think what I need to do here is to sell 12k/50k = 24% of my AMZN stocks. Is this correct?"|0.73|5|0|5

Sankyo has cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 Billion Dollars and almost no debt which results in 32,7$ Cash per share.

I calculated an approximately Asset Value of 2,098 Billion Dollar which results in 36,13$ per share.

The company has a high profitmargin of 30% which speaks for its strong marketposition.
I only know about one competing company which is Fujishoji Ltd a way smaller buisness in the same segment but with smaller profitmargin and decreasing revenue while the revenue of Sankyo is increasing strongly.

They both only earn money in Japan selling panchikos but it looks like sankyo establishing a Monopoly by gaining more and more marketshare.

Also the Cashflow is increasing very strongly. I calculated an average FCF-growth rate of 35,5% over the last 7 years and used a Discountrate of 15% which seems very conservative and calculated an intrinsic value of approximately 120$ per share. The current price is 45$ so we are applying a Margin of Safety of 65%.

In conclusion for me it seems like Sankyo is very strong buisness with an almost perfect balancesheet. It is increasing its revenue and free Cashflow constantly and has a high profitmargin and ROIC it is also paying a reliable dividend of 2.7%.
I know that in times of digitalisation the use of non-digital games will decrease but panchiko is a cult game which can be found in almost every japanese street. Because of the fact that this segment is decreasing I think that the probability of new entrants is very small which makes it easier to establish a Monopoly for Sankyo. 

Please let me know your thoughts about Sankyo. In my opinion it could be a perfect value company with a flourishing future in a shrinking industry.😉"|0.78|46|0|46

She lost her job a few months later and can no longer afford to pay the monthly payments

Monthly payments are roughly $3,300 but once a year there is a income of ~$20k from the property so on average the monthly payments are around $1633 if you adjust for earned income (I would still be paying $3300 out of pocket monthly though).

Taxes are cheap and only about $1k per year

I earn enough money to afford the monthly payments but I have some significant expenses myself as I bought a house less than 2 years ago

My mortgage monthly is $5k
The new property would be $3.3k

My income post taxes is roughly $13.5k per month

The property is probably still worth about the same or may be slightly increased to $625k from the original $605k price tag

There is still ~$450k loan as my mom paid ~$150k down and another $20k for closing costs

My mom wants me to take ownership of the property and she doesn't expect me to pay her back anything and just wants to sign the property under my name so she doesn't have to make the monthly payments. I guess it's a good deal for me since I can sell the property and still make some profit or make the monthly payments and potentially make a bigger profit in the future 

The question is, would I be better off making those monthly $3.3k payments into some other investment rather than this farmland. Some of it is going to interest anyway and I'm not sure how much appreciation farmland will have over the next year, 5 years, 10 years etc.

15p1xqb|1691838937.0|investing|Copper is the #1 Medium to Long Term Opportunity Out There, Here's Why|"Both the supply and demand dynamics in the copper market are looking incredibly favorable.  
From a 2022 Goldman Sachs report, ""Copper is so integral to the green transition – a global effort underpinned by government support – that the supply requirements necessitate a spike in copper prices""  
**Demand will increase**  
EVs, EV charging, electrical transmission, and renewables all use a lot of copper, and are set to grow for the foreseeable future.  
For example, an EV uses at least 2x more copper than a gas powered car.  
There also isn't a clear replacement for copper in these products, meaning the price can continue to rise without destroying demand.  
Aluminum is the most likely potential replacement, but not nearly as efficient (it would require a much higher volume of aluminum to do the same job).  
**Supply will not keep up**  
Supply is expected to fall well short of demand in the 2nd half of this decade.  
Ore grades are declining at many of the largest copper mines and there have been almost no major new discoveries in recent years.  
New copper mines can take 10 years to get up to full production, so they would not contribute to the supply equation until 2033.  
**TL;DR:** the world is going to need a lot of copper, there is no viable substitute, and the supply wont be there.  
**Disclosure:** I am long COPX, FCX, IVPAF and IE, though these do not constitute a large % of my portfolio yet.  
What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything? The most likely threat to the thesis above as far as I can see would be a breakthrough in extraction technology that dramatically increases supply.

15ndzih|1691677539.0|investing|How to retire in 9 years?|"**Context:**

I'm a 28 year old USMC Vet, No wife no kids no real financial obligations. I have passive income from VA disability that I want to use to snowball retirement and retire between the ages of 37-40. So I would retire in 9 years minimum, possibly 12 years. I have abunch of service connected disabilities that control my life. Currently I am able to work while having these disabilities but they will get worse as time goes on and there will most likely be a point in life (Possibly in my 40s) where I can not physically work anymore. So I want to snowball my passive income right now into a retirement nest egg that I can hopefully live off of when the day comes that my disabilities are too much to continue working.

**Income:**

\-Mechanical Engineer Salary - 65k/yr

\-100% VA Disability + SMC = 48K/yr ($4,000 a month, this is tax free and doesn't count as income)

\-I do not need this VA disability to live currently, So the plan is to ignore it and have it auto invest while I solely live off my current engineering salary.

**Somethings to note:**

\-Currently I have no real financial obligations. I am single, No wife and no kids, no debt.

\-I do plan on being married with kids in the future, but want to take advantage of the lack of financial obligations right now to be as aggressive as possible with saving this money.

\-I will retain my military health insurance until I am 65. At 65 it will continue as long as I have 40 credits of contributing to social security / Medicare (Hence the 9 year minimum time frame, as I currently have 4 credits). This health insurance will be extended to my future wife and kids, so health care costs during retirement won't be necessary to factor in.

\-This VA disability income is for life, whether I die at 35yo or at 105yo.

\-The VA disability income grows 1.5-3.5% a year to match COLA.

\-Once I retire, I will stop investing the VA Disability and use it to live. (This gives me a baseline of 50k/yr tax free on top of whatever the nest egg will provide)

\-My ROTH IRA and Jobs ROTH 401k are in great shape, but I obviously won't touch those until my 60s. I will be doing all of this in a taxable account and trying to live off a taxable account until this

**The goal:**

Build a nest egg as aggressively as possible right now so that in X years when my disabilities are too much for me to continue working, I can comfortably live off of this nest egg + the 50k/yr in VA disability.

An example would be I put all monthly disability into SCHD ($4k/month, 48k/yr) and according to the dividend calculator im looking at that would yield me 20k/yr in dividends in 9 years. That would be 70k/yr in passive income (VA disability + 20k/yr in dividends, as I would switch from investing the VA disability to living off of it when I stop working).

**Currently:**

I'm using it to buy speculative stocks and blue chip tech stocks ie Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Google, Rivian, Palantir, Paypal, etc. But this is alot riskier than ETF's.

**The question:**

\-If you were in this exact situation, how would you invest this money in order to best secure a comfortable future where you are not able to physically work / live life to the fullest?

\-Would you invest strictly into ETFS? Some individual stock picks some ETFs?

\-Would you do Dividend ETFs?

\-Should I max out my ROTH 401k to lower my current taxable income and live off of the tax free VA income right now instead of investing it? The problem I see with this is I wouldnt be able to touch it until 59.5 YO

\-What about high yield ETFs like JEPI or SPYI? Or would these be too risky with out alot of historical data behind them?

I realize none of us are certified financial planners, and I do plan on going to one. Just wanted to get a broad idea of a suitable investing path beforehand."|0.72|115|0|115

I am 42M, married to a 44F with a 12 year old son. Both make good money. 

Unfortunately I have not done much market/stock investing up until 2019 or so. 

I currently have about $250k in 401k and IRA mostly in target date funds, $600-700k in RE equity (personal and STR investment which is generating a nice income with minimal involvement from me) and about $700-750k in cash with about $300k invested in a fairly liquid investment generating a 9% interest income and the rest in a HYSA earning 5.4%. That investment opportunity is about to end though in a few months so for the sake of discussion let’s say I have $750k in cash. By the end of the year it’ll be closer to a $1m in cash as I’m saving a large portion of our income and our expenses are pretty low. 

I’m looking to deploy the cash and the idea of dividends is very appealing to me.
