# NLP
This Repo contains some of my notes in relation to Natural Language Processing (NLP). I will try to update it as I proceed with my NLP journey.

### Requirments
The requirements and Library used can be found in requirements.txt. Hopefully, all notebooks can be run on Google Colab with no problems. 

## Contents
#### 1. Pre-processing Techniques
I will share some common techniques used for NLP pre-processing in the [NLP_Preprocessing.ipynb] (https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/NLP_Preprocessing.ipynb)
  -  Removing Stopwords
  -  Tokens
  -  Stemming
  -  Lemmatization
  -  Unicode Normalization
    

#### 2. Attention
Common Attention mechanisms in relation to NLP can be found in [NLP_Attention.ipynb] (https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/NLP_Attention.ipynb)
  - Encoder-Decoder Attention (Dot-Product Attention)
  - Self Attention
  - Bidirectional Attention
  - Multi-head Attentenion

#### 3. Language Classifications
Some Sentiment classification techniques are explored in this notebook. [NLP_Language_Classification_Flair_Transformers] (https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/NLP_Language_Classification_Flair_Transformers)
  - Sentiment Classification with flair
  - Sentiment Classification with Transformers
