# NLP
This Repo contains some of my notes in relation to Natural Language Processing (NLP). I will try to update it as I proceed with my NLP journey.

### Requirments
The requirements and Library used can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/requirements.txt). Hopefully, all notebooks can be run on Google Colab with no problems. 

## Contents
### 1. Pre-processing Techniques
I will share some common techniques used for NLP pre-processing in the 
[NLP_Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/NLP_Preprocessing.ipynb)
  -  Removing Stopwords
  -  Tokens
  -  Stemming
  -  Lemmatization
  -  Unicode Normalization
    

### 2. Attention
Common Attention mechanisms in relation to NLP can be found in [NLP_Attention.ipynb](https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/NLP_Attention.ipynb)
  - Encoder-Decoder Attention (Dot-Product Attention)
  - Self Attention
  - Bidirectional Attention
  - Multi-head Attentenion

### 3. Language Classifications
Some Sentiment classification techniques are explored in this notebook. [NLP_Language_Classification_Flair_Transformers](https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/NLP_Language_Classification_Flair_Transformers.ipynb)
  - Sentiment Classification with flair
  - Sentiment Classification with Transformers

### 4. Long Text Classification
Similar to 3, but here we explore other techniques if the sample size is bigger than the transformer capabilities [Long_text_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/Azizkhaled/NLP-with-Aziz/blob/main/Long_text_classification.ipynb)

  - Bert issue
  - Long text solution: Window Partitioning
  - Applying window method using Pytorch
